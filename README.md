# ecommerce-data-extraction
This project explores an e-commerce dataset using Python and SQL to analyze key metrics such as customer behavior, order patterns, and product performance. It combines data manipulation with pandas, visualization with matplotlib/seaborn, and SQL integration via sqlite3 for real-world data querying and relational operations.
